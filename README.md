📊 Expense & Cost Optimization Dashboard (Power BI)
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing large-scale expense data to understand spending behavior, cost drivers, financial efficiency, and savings outcomes.
Using Power BI, the dashboard is designed to simulate an enterprise-style financial analytics use case, moving beyond basic reporting to deliver actionable insights.

The analysis follows a structured approach:

Establish financial baselines

Evaluate efficiency through ratios

Identify cost drivers

Segment behavior across income groups


🎯 Business Objectives

The project aims to answer the following key business questions:

How much income and expense exists at an aggregate level?

How efficiently is income being spent?

Where does the majority of spending occur?

How much of spending is fixed vs discretionary?

Which income groups experience higher financial pressure?

How do savings outcomes vary across income segments?


🧩 Dataset Summary

Format: CSV

Scale: ~20,000+ records

Nature: Consumer-level income and expense data

Scope: Rent, groceries, transport, utilities, loan repayments, insurance, discretionary expenses

The dataset is treated as a consumer expense portfolio, enabling enterprise-style cost and efficiency analysis.

📐 Analytical Framework
1️⃣ Baseline KPIs (Financial Scale)

Aggregate Income

Total Expense

Net Savings

These KPIs establish overall financial capacity, consumption, and outcome.


2️⃣ Efficiency KPIs

Expense-to-Income Ratio

Savings Rate

These ratios normalize totals and provide performance-based insights.


3️⃣ Cost Driver Analysis

Expense Composition by Category

Fixed vs Discretionary Cost Split

This layer identifies dominant spending categories and realistic optimization opportunities.


4️⃣ Segmentation Analysis

Income Group Classification (Low / Middle / High)

Expense-to-Income Ratio by Income Group

Savings Rate by Income Group

Segmentation reveals how efficiency and savings outcomes vary across income levels.

Individual-level ratios were averaged within groups to avoid aggregation bias.

Cost Structure: Fixed vs Discretionary (Stacked Bar)

Expense-to-Income Ratio by Income Group

Savings Rate by Income Group

Purpose: Identify cost drivers, optimization levers, and segment-level behavior.


🔍 Key Insights

Rent and groceries together account for a majority of total expenses.

Fixed costs form a substantial portion of spending, but discretionary costs offer meaningful optimization potential.

Expense pressure remains relatively consistent across income groups in this dataset.

Higher income groups demonstrate slightly better savings outcomes, indicating stronger financial resilience.
